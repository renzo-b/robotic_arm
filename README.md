# Robotic Arm 
A robotic arm made from scratch (design, build, code). I built this for fun and with hopes to use it for some AI projects. 
- 3D printed
- 5 DOF (gripper missing)
- Uses dynamixel motors and a U2D2 to connect dynamixels to a PC
- Controllable with ROS. Works with common plugins such as RVIZ, Gazebo, and Moveit. 

This is my first ROS project, so I heavily relied on books, tutorials, and this excellent github project: https://github.com/verlab/Fenrir-Arm

## Main Updates
- 12-01-2021: Finished Solidworks assembly
- 01-12-2022: ROS MoveIt working with dynamixel motors. Movement of the arm is jittery, but it can be greatly improved through some better mechanical design.
